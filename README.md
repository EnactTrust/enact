# EnactTrust agent

_Open-source software that enables you to monitor the health of your system_

## How it works

EnactTrust has two components, the Enact agent application(this software) and a Security Cloud.

*   The open source agent generates fresh evidence about the device and system health.
*   The EnactTrust Security Cloud processes the evidence and verifies the system health is good or bad.
*   The current health of any node protected by EnactTrust can be monitored using the Web Dashboad of the EnactTrust Security Cloud.

Note: The process of providing evidence about the system health is called attestation.

### EnactTrust removes the high R&D cost and breaks the know-how barrier

Until today, this technology has been leveraged only by large enterprise. Now, thanks to EnactTrust, everyone can use attestation technology to improve their system security.

### Installation

Please check the INSTALL.md file for step by step instructions.

## Tiers

This version of EnactTrust is called "Quick Start" and is designed toward ease of use. Run the agent and experience the benefits of Trusted Computing. However, EnactTrust is designed to run in a memory isolated environment, so it can protect your system when your device is compromised or under attack.

Here is the complete list of EnactTrust versions:

*   Quick start - Basic attestation for 1 node (this version).
*   Developer - Advanced attestation for 5 nodes.
*   Team - Up to 5 Developers, each with 10 nodes.
*   Enterprise - Protecting IoT products during their entire lifecycle, ZeroTrust security model for critical infrastructure, available on premise and as a managed service, EnactTrust agent deployed in memory isolation to protect the system even in the case of an attack.

## History

The original concept of EnactTrust emerged during 2017 and involves the largest trade fair for "Internet of Things" - Embedded World in Nuremberg/Germany. For the very first time there was a dedicated Trusted Platform Module(TPM) track. Presenters included managers from ARM,  OnSemi and other industry leaders. Surprisingly, no one from the five speakers talked about Trusted Computing or mentioned the use of TPM 2.0 modules.

The capability to build trust into a computer system remained just a marketing slogan in 2017. Therefore, in early 2018 we built the first prototype of what later became known as EnactTrust. It took years of development and testing with interested companies to define the core features and qualities of EnactTrust that we have today.

The current "Quick Start" version of EnactTrust is re-written to use the open-source wolfTPM and libcurl librariers, and targets Linux for ease of use.
